/// @page Undo
///
/// This extension enables the plugin to merge its undo history with the host.
/// This leads to a single undo history shared by the host and many plugins.
///
/// Calling host->undo() or host->redo() is equivalent to clicking undo/redo within the host's GUI.
///
/// If the plugin uses this interface then its undo and redo should be entirely delegated to
/// the host; clicking in the plugin's UI undo or redo is equivalent to clicking undo or redo in the
/// host's UI.
///
/// Some changes are long running changes, for example a mouse interaction will begin editing some
/// complex data and it may take multiple events and a long duration to complete the change.
/// In such case the plugin will call host->begin_change() to indicate the beginning of a long
/// running change and complete the change by calling host->change_made().
///
/// The host may group changes together:
/// [---------------------------------]
/// ^-T0      ^-T1    ^-T2            ^-T3
/// Here a long running change C0 begin at T0.
/// A instantaneous change C1 at T1, and another one C2 at T2.
/// Then at T3 the long running change is completed.
/// The host will then create a single undo step that will merge all the changes into C0.
///
/// This leads to another important consideration: starting a long running change without
/// terminating is **VERY BAD**, because while a change is running it is impossible to call undo or
/// redo.
///
/// Rationale: multiple designs were considered and this one has the benefit of having a single undo
/// history. This simplifies the host implementation, leading to less bugs, a more robust design
/// and maybe an easier experience for the user because there's a single undo context versus one
/// for the host and one for each plugin instance.
///
/// This extension tries to make it as easy as possible for the plugin to hook into the host undo
/// and make it efficient when possible by using deltas. The plugin interfaces are all optional, and
/// the plugin can for a minimal implementation, just use the host interface and call
/// host->change_made() without providing a delta. This is enough for the host to know that it can
/// capture a plugin state for the undo step.
